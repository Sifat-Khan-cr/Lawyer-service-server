        info:"Taking the step to divorce in Bangladesh could affect both spouses when the right processes are not utilized. Because the procedure to dissolve the relationship is so exact with only three stages for completion, if any of these are not performed as specified, the husband and wife are not considered divorced. However, the wife is permitted a different process based on Muslim Family Law Ordinance established in 1961. This was created for dower monies afforded to the as yet unmarried wife and for maintenance of herself and any children that would be living with her. This is possible through a family court with a civil suit. The Section 7 part of this ordinance is what provides the divorce grounds.",

        info:"The law became intimately involved in medical practice in the 20th century. Historically, legal medicine, or forensic medicine, was a field devoted exclusively to the uses of medicine in the courtroom, primarily in two settings: forensic pathology and forensic psychiatry. The pathologist has traditionally been asked to determine and testify to the cause of death in cases of suspected homicide and to aspects of various injuries involving crimes such as assault and rape. Medical testimony may also be required in civil cases involving, for example, occupational injury, negligent injury, automobile accidents, and paternity suits. Similarly, when a defendant pleads insanity as a defense, a psychiatrist is asked to examine the defendant and to testify as to his or her mental state at the time of the crime. The relevant question is usually whether the defendant’s criminal behaviour was the product of a mental illness or whether he or she was able to distinguish right from wrong. In civil cases, psychiatrists frequently appear as witnesses in cases of child custody and involuntary commitment for mental illness.",
